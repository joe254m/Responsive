				<h2>Audi A6</h2>
				<p>The 2020 Audi A6 Allroad is a new station-wagon model with standard all-wheel drive and body cladding to make it look more SUV-like. We took it to Beaver Island, a remote location in the middle of Lake Michigan, for some exploring.

				<h2>BMW 7 SERIES</h2>
				<p>The 7-series' extensive list of luxury equipment includes leather or optional cashmere upholstery, an 18-speaker Bowers & Wilkins audio system (audiophiles can upgrade to a 36-speaker setup), and available electrically powered doors that close at the touch of a buttonâ€”like those on a Rolls-Royce.

				<h2>Chevrolet Corvette ZR1</h2>
				<p>The 2026 Chevrolet Corvette C8 ZR1 has 1064 horsepower radiating from its mid-mounted twin-turbo V-8. The already proven C8 chassis gets tweaked for duty with a standard adaptive suspension and massive brakes.

				<h2>Ferrari 12 Clindri</h2>
				<p>The 12Cilindri arrives for the 2025 model year with a naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V-12 engine that breathes deeply and revs to an ear-splitting 9500 rpm. The beastly engine that snarls under the long hood pumps out 819 horsepower and 500 pound-feet of torque, which is sent to the rear wheels via an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission.

				<h2>Mazda CX-5</h2>
				<p>The current Mazda CX-5 crossover has been in production since 2017, an eternity in the car business. Even among newer compact-crossover rivals, though, the CX-5 continues to shine as one of the most attractive choices that's also one of the best to drive. Mazda debuted the slightly larger, slightly pricier CX-50 in 2023, but the CX-5 lineup was not scaled back to make way for its new stablemate.

					<h2>Hyundai Elantra</h2>
					<p> The 2025 Hyundai Elantra wears a snazzy look and offers several high-end features that enhance its appeal. No one needs to know you spent less than $30,000. Three powertrains are offered, starting with a base four-cylinder with 147 horsepower.
					</p>

					<h2>Jeep Compass</h2>
					<p>The Compass was always the more attractive of the two, with greater interior space and tidier dimensions. The Compass is powered by a relatively efficient 200-hp four-cylinder backed by an unobtrusive eight-speed automatic, and while not as fun to drive as many of its competitors it does have polite on-road manners and a comfortable ride.</p>

				<h2>Porsche 718 Boxster</h2>
				<p> The soft-top Boxster shares powertrains and just about everything else but its roof with the hard-top Cayman coupe, and while you can get both with nearly 500 horsepower, even the 300-hp base models are soul-satisfying, as they benefit from the same fantastic transmissions and wonderfully tuned chassis as the more expensive, more powerful versions.

				<h2>Volkswagen Golf GTI</h2>
				<p>The VW Golf GTI has combined the same desirable attributes for decades: sharp handling, an eager powertrain, and surprising practicality. The newest model doesn't diverge from that formula, but it does introduce some new technology while losing the option of a manual transmission. </p>
